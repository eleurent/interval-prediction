  abstract = {Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems are models widely encountered
	in the engineering field. In this paper, a systematic method is provided
	to design a polytopic observer whose goal is to reconstruct the state
	of discrete-time LPV systems. The method incorporates in an original
	manner a minimal convex polytope finding and thereby confers efficiency
	to the reconstruction technique. The proposed approach is illustrated
	in the context of secure communications based on chaotic parameter
	modulation.},
